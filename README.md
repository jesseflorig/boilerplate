# [WIP] Boilerplate

A **[WIP]** boilerplate for building web applications, but mostly something I set up once (pending) and leave to become perpetually stale. *Yay!*

## The Stack
 
 - Package Management: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
 - Build: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
 - Front End: [React](https://reactjs.org/)
 - Styling: [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
 - State: [Apollo Link](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/link/) **[WIP]**
 - Data: [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) **[WIP]**
 - Testing: [Jest & Enzyme]() **[WIP]**

## Gaps

 - UI: [Material-UI](), [Symantic UI]()
